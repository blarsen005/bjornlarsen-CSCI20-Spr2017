Program Description:
    This program outputs Wind Chill information based on user input values of temperature and wind speed.
    There are two formulas used to calculate wind chill: an older one and a newer one. This program outputs
    wind chill values calculated through both methods and also outputs the difference between both methods'
    values.
    
Pseudocode:
    0) Make sure to include <cmath>!
    1) Initialize variables: temperature, initial wind speed, old wind chill, new wind chill, wind chill difference.
    2) User inputs temperature and starting wind speed.
    3) Calculate old wind chill value; use sqrt function.
    4) Calculate new wind chill value; use pow function.
    5) Calculate wind chill difference; use abs function.
    6) Output Wind Speed, Old Formula, New Formula, and Difference.
