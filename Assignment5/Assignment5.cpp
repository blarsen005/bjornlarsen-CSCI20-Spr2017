Problem Description:

Create a program of your choice. This should have personal meaning for you and help you understand how programming can help in your field.
Requirements
    
    A class
    A decision or loop (or both)
    An array or strings (or both)
    File Input/Output
    Appropriate user input/output and user error handling
    
*/

/*
This program will guide a user through the process of creating a character for Dungeons and Dragons 5E. It is intended
to be useful both for newbies unfamiliar to the franchise as well as for experienced players. Throughout the program, the
user will be prompted to input a large amount of information, mostly by use of the console and a bit through use of file input.
When the program is finished, all information will be output to a separate character sheet. The user will enter preliminary information,
which includes information such as base stats (rolled randomly), race, and class. They will then enter further character information
that is based off of the preliminary information, such as accounting for certain features of race or class that might affect
stats. Lastly, the user will enter battle-related information, such as items and spells. This program is also going to use
separate files for storing information about races, classes, and spells, as well as general information.
The reason I am creating this program is because I am going to be guiding some players this summer through this exact same process
and if the program turns out well they could even use this instead of asking me to explain it to them. Also I'm going to need to
know all the races and classes before the summer so writing this program will force me to research them.
*/

/*
Algorithm
Step 1: Introduce player to character creation process. During ANY step of the program, the user
can type "/info" to receive the information regarding the specifics of the current step and/or more detailed information. During most
of the steps of character creation, user can input "/skip" to skip the current step. This cannot be done for stats, class, or race, and
the program will remind the user of what steps they skipped at the end of the program.

Step 2: First create he character object.

Step 3: Ability Scores rolled, stored in an array. Each array value will be 4d6 dropping the lowest value. If the sum of all the values
are too high or too low, reroll them again. If the sum is within a certain range, display the stats in order from highest to lowest. These
will be allocated later.

Step 4: Player selects a race for the character, and base speed is set as well. Pertinent Race information is included in file used for final
output.

Step 5: Player decides a class for the character. Each class will have a primary stat, hit die, saving throw proficiencies, and armor and
weapons proficiencies. Each class starts with features at level one and will gain access to more as they level up. Write down the characterâ€™s
level one class features under the features section of the character sheet. Also write down your proficiency bonus.

Step 6: User now gets to input name and alignment.

Step 7: User is prompted they are to create their background and submit it as a file to the program, with an example background listed in the
program folder. Any features, traits, bonds, ideals, flaws, proficiencies, etc that are a result of the background should be included in the file.

Step 8: User gets to assign ability scores now. Within the base class sit 6 variables for str, dex, con, int, wis, and cha, and user lists
which stats they want to be their highest, and which to be lowest. Add/lower any stats that are affected by racial modifiers. (Also make
sure ability modifer get functions are in place.)

Step 9: Functions for saving throws. User will enter skills.

Step 10: Set Initiative and Passive Wisdom

Steo 11: Set hit points - hit die plus constitution modifier

Step 12: Set languages.

Step 13: Choose equipment (from pre-determined set)

Step 14: Determine Armor Class.

Step 15: Set/Choose Weapons/Spells

Step 16: User is done - Output to character sheet

Pseudocode:
Class
    private
        All character attributes, including race, class, name, alignment, stats, and more.
    public
        Constructor sets all attributes to zero, except proficiency
        Get/Set functions for attributes
        Get functions for more attributes, including proficiency modifiers
Print Info from file function
Main
    Initialize any variables that will be used to execute the program
    Initialize any variables that are used to indicate what has been skipped
    Initialize any variables that are pertinent to the character
    Output beginning of program
    Create Character Object
    Roll Ability Scores
        For loop with four different random numbers that change each iteration - set to values in the array
    Select Race (Get info from external file) Set speed
    Select Class (Get info from external file) Set features
    Select name & alignment
    User inputs file containing background
    Assign ability scores (in order of highest to lowest) assigned to class
    Select skills (function in class determining number and variety of skills)
    Select languages (function in class determining number and variety of languages)
    Choose equipment (& determine AC) & weapons
    If user is a spellcaster select skills (from external file)
    Output to character sheet
