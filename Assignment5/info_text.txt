START
/*
You are about to create your character for Dungeons and Dragons,
5th edition. This program will mostly be using the standard races,
classes and rules from the 5e Player's Handbook. You can get more
information about the character creation process using the handbook,
or you can learn more later throughout the program. Keep in mind
that you will be free to skip certain steps if you are unsure, and
your final character sheet output is just that - your character sheet,
which you can change however you want after you are finished.
*/

STATS
/*
You are about to roll your character's base stats. There are two main
ways stats are typically set in D&D 5e. The main way is to roll 4d6 and
add the highest 3 values for each stat, but oftentimes people will choose
to go with a standard array of stats: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Both options
are available here, so if you decide you wouldn't like your stats to be
rolled randomly, skipping the step will set your stats to the standard
array.
.
One added feature to the stat rolling in this program is that if you
end up being rolled some really high or really low stats overall, they will
be rerolled, or else you'd find the players are unbalanced with regards to
each other. If you roll your stats your overall average won't come out any
lower than about 10.7 or any higher than about 13.3.
.
These stats you will eventually allocate into Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. More on this later, but
keep in mind that you can use what you rolled for your base stats to help
shape your character. For instance, if you rolled a really low stat, you
can start thinking about using it to represent some sort of detriment your
character may have.
*/

RACES
/*
You are currently determining your race. This is a necessary step as it's
important in determining several other aspects of your character. There are
many races in the world of D&D, including several others not included in this
program for simplicity's sake. If you have an idea for a character that demands
a race other than one listed here, you shouldn't let the limitations of this
program limit you. Also keep in mind that all racial features listed are just
what is accessible at level 1, and many more features are added as your character
levels up. For more information, check out the Player's Handbook.

NAME
/*
It's time to start entering personal background-related information that differentiates
our character from every other, and that of course starts with the character's name.
Your character's name may pertain to your race, background, or anything else that
is relevant to you. If you haven't decided a name or don't want to enter one yet,
you can totally skip this as well.
*/

ALIGNMENT
/*
A typical creature in the worlds of D&D has an alignment, which broadly describes its
moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combinalion of two factors: one identifies
morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes altitudes toward society and
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible
combinations. A chart of these is listed below. If you are not sure of your character's
alignment, don't worry about it and just type /skip, or whatever you want because it
doesn't really matter.
.
These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature
with that alignment. Individuais might vary significantly from that typical behavior,
and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
.
LG (Lawful Good) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society.
Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.
NG (Neutral Good) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many
celestiais, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.
CG (Chaotic Good) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what
others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
LN (Lawful Good) individuais act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.
Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.
N (True Neutral) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer c1ear of moral questions
and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and
many humans are neutral.
CN (Chaotic Neutral) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above
all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.
LE (Lawful Evil) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of acode
of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.
NE (Neutral Evil) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without
compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil.
CE (Chaotic Evil) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred,
or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.
*/

BACKGROUND
/*
For your background in this program it will be entered in the form of a separate text file.
Included also is an example background text, including all the sections that are background-
related. Following a similar format as the sample background is recommended for the best
character sheet, but it not mandatory. On top of this, since you are inputting your own
file, you can format it however you want with whatever information you think is necessary
for the character sheet. One other point of note is that backgrounds can often offer bonus
proficiencies and other features. If using a standard background from the Player's Handbook,
make sure to include these. Generally it is recommended to modify what is listed in the
handbook to add some variety, hence your inputting your own sheet.
*/

ALLOCATION
/*
We rolled our stats towards the beginning of the program, now that we finally have our race,
class, and background set, we hopefully know what kind of character we are going for and it's
now the most ideal point to allocate our stats. Each stat is pretty straightforward. Strength
measures physical power, Dexterity measures agility, Constitution measures endurance,
Intelligence measures reasoning and memory, Wisdom measures perception and insight, and
Charisma measures force of personality. You will be allocating your stats in the order of
highest priority to lowest priority, and you'll get to see which base stat will be allocated
to it. Your stats are subject to bonuses and will not be the exact same as your base stats.
Your stats also affect your stat modifers and your saving throws, which will be displayed
after allocation.
.
Barbarian - Strength
Bard - Charisma
Cleric - Wisdom
Druid - Wisdom
Fighter - Strength or Dexterity
Monk - Dexterity and Wisdom
Paladin - Strength and Charisma
Ranger - Dexterity and Wisdom
Rogue - Dexterity
Sorcerer - Charisma
Warlock - Charisma
Wizard - Intelligence
*/

SKILLS
/*
You are now selecting your skills. Depending on your class and race, you have access to a
certain number and variety of skills to give yourself proficiency in, similarly to saving
throws. There are a lot of skills in the game, so you will have to use the chart below to
determine which skills you have access to (in the program, the skills do not have their
own variables, so they are represented by a print function). Skills without proficiency
are simply affected by your stat modifiers.

LANGUAGES
/*
All races have access to "Common", the mostly universal language that connect
the many peoples of D&D and their respective languages. Certain classes also gain
access to more languages - If you receive specific bonuses you can access many
languages that are inaccessible otherwise. Here is a chart you can use to find
out what races and classes speak each language, and also see all the other languages
you might be able to choose:
.
Common: All Races
Dwarvish: Dwarves
Elvish: Elves, Half-Elves
Giant: -
Gnomish: Gnomes
Goblin: -

IF you are one of the following races or classes, you can receive bonus
languages you wouldn't know otherwise:
High Elves, Humans, and Half-Elves: +1 bonus language
Rangers: +1 bonus language
Knowledge Clerics: +2 bonus languages
*/

ARMOR
/*
Certain classes have proficiency in certain types of armor. If you do not have
proficiency, you will suffer from disadvantages and inability to cast spells if
using the armor. A chart below shows which classes have proficiency in what armor
varieties. Here you will get to select your armor variety, but the catch is that
it will remove some of your initial wealth. As far as the armor types: The light
armor class grants you a base AC plus your dexterity modifier, medium gives a max
of +2 dexterity, and heavy grants no bonus AC. Also, Heavy armor and certain
medium armors grant disadvantage on stealth checks. Also , certain strength
parameters are required if rmor if heavy enough. If you choose to not roll with
armor, then your AC is 10 + dex mod.
.
Barbarian - Light and medium armor, shields
Bard - Light armor
Cleric - Light and medium armor, shields
....Life Cleric - And Heavy armor
....Nature Cleric - And Heavy armor
....Tempest Cleric - And Heavy Armor
....War Cleric - And Heavy Armor

Wizard - No proficiencies
.

*/

WEAPONS
/*
Like the last step, the program is going to assume you have proficiency with the
weapon you select. You can confirm this by checking the chart below. You are
using the remainder of your wealth (if you choose) to purchase whatever weapon
you choose. Highly recommended to confer with the below charts to make sure your
character can use it properly. You can also feel free to add more weapons with
remaining gold after creating the character sheet or check the players handbook
to see pre-set equipment.
.
Barbarian: simple and martial weapons
Bard: simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords
Cleric: simple weapons
....Tempest Cleric: add martial weapons
....War Cleric: add martial weapons
Druid: clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears

Rogue: simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords
Sorcerer: daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows

only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.
Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength
or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.
Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting
with two weapons.
Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of
ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it,
regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses
after the ammunition or thrown property.
Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.
Special: Aweapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use.
Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.
Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.
*/

EQUIPMENT
/*
Each class gets some extra equipment they can choose from. Each kind of pack contains a variety
of different items you can find in the player's handbook. It's important to note that
backgrounds give access to various equipments, so be sure to check if your background gives
you anything special.
*/

SPELLS
/*
You have chosen one of the spellcasting classes, so that means you are a magical person who
can cast spells. The different classes each get different spells, so depending on which
you picked, you will have access to completely different spell lists. When you start this
step of the program you'll get to see the different spells you can or should choose.
After selecting these, you'll also get to see your number of spell slots, and your
spellcasting ability.
